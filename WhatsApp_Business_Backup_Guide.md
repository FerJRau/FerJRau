# WhatsApp Business Backup Guide for Mac

## Overview

This comprehensive guide provides multiple methods for backing up WhatsApp Business conversations from a Mac for archiving and analysis purposes. After extensive research, we found that **Meta's "Download Your Information" tool does NOT include WhatsApp Business conversation data** - it only covers Facebook/Instagram data and limited WhatsApp Business profile information if linked to Facebook Business Page.

## Key Finding: Meta's Limitations

Meta's "Download Your Information" tool has significant limitations for WhatsApp Business users:
- Does NOT include conversation messages or chat history
- Only includes basic profile information if WhatsApp Business is linked to Facebook Business Page
- Limited to account settings, catalog data, and transaction information
- Maximum of 6 months of chat history even when linked (not comprehensive)
- End-to-end encryption prevents access to personal conversations

## Available Backup Methods
